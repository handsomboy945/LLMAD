However, the peach in the second image appears to be different in color and texture compared to the one in the first image. The peach in the first image has a more vibrant red-orange hue, while the peach in the second image has a more muted, yellowish-red color. This difference in appearance suggests a logical anomaly, as the same type of fruit should have consistent characteristics.\n\nThere are no structural anomalies present in the images, as both appear to have the same container shape and layout.\n\nTherefore, the anomaly detected is a logical anomaly related to the color and texture of the peach.",
