Carefully compare the two images to determine if there are any anomalies in the test image.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Focus on Significant Deviations:** Identify anomalies based on significant deviations from the reference sample, such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, contamination, or major structural changes. Acceptable natural variations (e.g., slight differences in fruit coloration, size, or arrangement) should be considered normal unless they exceed typical ranges.\n2. **Clarify Normal Variations:** Define typical ranges for natural variations (e.g., fruit coloration, size, and arrangement) and instruct the model to accept these as normal unless they exceed the defined thresholds. Provide examples of acceptable variations to help the model differentiate between normal and anomalous states.\n3. **Ensure Logical Consistency:** Pay attention to the overall composition and logical consistency of the contents. For example, if the reference sample includes nuts, the absence or substitution of nuts with another ingredient (e.g., dried banana slices) should be flagged as an anomaly.\n4. **Ignore Minor Differences:** Minor differences that do not impact the overall quality or safety of the product (e.g., slight scattering of granola or minor changes in fruit positioning) should be ignored.\n5. **Provide Examples of Common Anomalies:** Include examples of common anomalies, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions, discoloration, or contamination, to help the model better understand what to look for.\n6. **Output Format:** If no anomalies are found, respond with: `<answer>No</answer>`. If anomalies are found, respond with: `<answer>Yes</answer>` followed by a list of bounding boxes in JSON format:\n   ```json\n   [{\"bbox_2d\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"label\": \"anomaly_type\"}, ...]\n   ```\n\n### Example:\n```xml\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n[{\"bbox_2d\": [100, 150, 200, 250], \"label\": \"fruit_substitution\"}]\n```\n\n### Additional Guidance:\n- **Natural Variations:** Acceptable natural variations include slight differences in fruit coloration, size, and arrangement. For example, a slightly larger orange or a different shade of peach is acceptable.\n- **Ingredient Substitutions:** Unexpected substitutions, such as replacing almonds with dried banana slices, should be flagged as anomalies.\n- **Contamination:** Any visible contamination, such as foreign objects or discoloration, should be identified as an anomaly.\n- **Structural Changes:** Major structural changes, such as missing ingredients or incorrect proportions, should be flagged as anomalies.\n\n### Example of Expected Output:\n```xml\n<answer>No</answer>\n```\n\nor\n\n```xml\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n[{\"bbox_2d\": [100, 150, 200, 250], \"label\": \"fruit_substitution\"}]\n```",

  "optimizer_analysis": "The current prompt has several issues that contribute to the observed error cases:\n\n  1. **False Positives (Case 1-3):**\n     - The model is overly sensitive to minor variations in natural features, such as slight differences in fruit coloration or arrangement, which are incorrectly flagged as anomalies.\n     - There is insufficient guidance on what constitutes a \"significant deviation,\" leading the model to misinterpret normal variations as anomalies.\n\n  2. **False Negatives (Case 4-6):**\n     - The model fails to detect real anomalies, particularly those involving logical inconsistencies, such as missing ingredients or unexpected substitutions.\n     - The criteria for identifying significant deviations are not clear enough, causing the model to overlook important anomalies.\n\n  3. **Type Misclassifications (Case 7-9):**\n     - The model struggles to correctly classify the type of anomaly, often mislabeling logical anomalies as other types (e.g., discoloration or contamination).\n     - There is a lack of specific examples and definitions to help the model distinguish between different anomaly types.\n\n  4. **Output Format Clarity:**\n     - While the output format is specified, the examples provided are not comprehensive enough to ensure the model fully understands the required JSON structure.\n\n  5. **Contextual Understanding:**\n     - The prompt does not sufficiently emphasize the importance of considering the context of the reference sample when evaluating the test image.",
  "improvement_strategy": "To address these issues, the following strategies will be implemented:\n\n  1. **Clarify Natural Variations:**\n     - Explicitly define typical ranges for natural variations (e.g., fruit coloration, size, arrangement, and ingredient proportions) and instruct the model to accept these as normal unless they exceed the defined thresholds.\n     - Provide more detailed examples of acceptable variations, including slight differences in fruit coloration, size, and arrangement, to help the model differentiate between normal and anomalous states.\n\n  2. **Enhance Anomaly Detection Criteria:**\n     - Specify that anomalies should be identified based on significant deviations from the reference sample, such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, contamination, or major structural changes.\n     - Encourage the model to focus on logical consistency and adherence to expected content, flagging any deviations that disrupt the expected composition.\n\n  3. **Improve Output Format Clarity:**\n     - Clearly state the required JSON format for the output, including the structure of bounding boxes and labels.\n     - Provide a more comprehensive example of the expected output, including multiple examples of different anomaly types, to ensure the model understands the format requirements.\n\n  4. **Strengthen Contextual Understanding:**\n     - Include instructions to consider the context of the reference sample when evaluating the test image.\n     - Guide the model to prioritize detecting anomalies that deviate from the expected composition or logical consistency.\n\n  5. **Reduce Over-Sensitivity:**\n     - Instruct the model to ignore minor differences that do not impact the overall quality or safety of the product.\n     - Encourage the model to focus on significant deviations that are likely to indicate defects.\n\n  6. **Address Type Misclassifications:**\n     - Clarify the distinction between acceptable natural variations and unacceptable anomalies, ensuring the model correctly identifies and labels each type.\n     - Provide specific examples of anomalies that should be flagged, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions, discoloration, or contamination.\n\n  7. **Refine the Definition of \"Significant Deviations\":**\n     - Provide clearer guidance on what constitutes a \"significant deviation,\" such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, or major structural changes.\n     - Encourage the model to focus on deviations that are likely to impact the quality or safety of the product.\n\n  8. **Include Examples of Common Anomalies:**\n     - Provide examples of common anomalies, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions, discoloration, or contamination, to help the model better understand what to look for.\n     - Encourage the model to use these examples as a reference when evaluating the test image.\n\n  9. **Simplify the Prompt:**\n     - Ensure the prompt is concise and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity that could confuse the model.\n     - Focus on the most critical aspects of the task, such as identifying significant deviations and maintaining logical consistency.",
