Carefully compare the two images to determine if there are any anomalies in the test image.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Focus on Significant Deviations:** Identify anomalies based on significant deviations from the reference sample, such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, contamination, or major structural changes. Acceptable natural variations (e.g., slight differences in fruit coloration, size, or arrangement) should be considered normal unless they exceed typical ranges.\n2. **Consider Normal Variations:** Acceptable natural variations (e.g., slight differences in fruit coloration, size, or arrangement) should be considered normal unless they exceed typical ranges. Provide examples of acceptable variations to help the model differentiate between normal and anomalous states.\n3. **Ensure Logical Consistency:** Pay attention to the overall composition and logical consistency of the contents. For example, if the reference sample includes nuts, the absence or substitution of nuts with another ingredient (e.g., dried banana slices) should be flagged as an anomaly.\n4. **Ignore Minor Differences:** Minor differences that do not impact the overall quality or safety of the product (e.g., slight scattering of granola or minor changes in fruit positioning) should be ignored.\n\n### Output Format:\n- If no anomalies are found, respond with: `<answer>No</answer>`\n- If anomalies are found, respond with: `<answer>Yes</answer>` followed by a list of bounding boxes in JSON format:\n  ```json\n  [{\"bbox_2d\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"label\": \"anomaly_type\"}, ...]\n  ```\n\nExample:\n```xml\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n[{\"bbox_2d\": [100, 150, 200, 250], \"label\": \"fruit_substitution\"}]\n```",

  "optimizer_analysis": "The current prompt suffers from several issues that contribute to the low recall and F1 score, as well as misclassifications:\n\n  1. **False Positives (Case 1):** The model incorrectly identifies normal areas as anomalies. This suggests that the criteria for distinguishing between natural variations and anomalies are not sufficiently clear or nuanced. The model may be overly sensitive to minor differences in texture or color.\n\n  2. **False Negatives (Cases 2-4):** The model fails to detect real anomalies, indicating that the criteria for identifying significant deviations are too lenient or vague. The model may not be focusing on the most critical aspects of the comparison, such as unexpected substitutions or major structural changes.\n\n  3. **Type Misclassifications (Cases 5-7):** The model misclassifies logical anomalies, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions, as other types of anomalies (e.g., fruit size variation). This suggests a lack of specificity in the instructions regarding how to categorize different types of anomalies.\n\n  4. **Over-Sensitivity to Minor Differences:** The instruction to \"ignore minor differences\" is not clearly defined, leading to inconsistent application by the model. Some minor differences may be flagged as anomalies, while others are overlooked.\n\n  5. **Lack of Contextual Understanding:** The model does not fully consider the context of the reference sample when evaluating the test image. For example, it may fail to recognize that certain ingredients should be present in specific quantities or arrangements.\n\n  6. **Output Format Ambiguity:** While the output format is specified, the examples provided may not be sufficient to ensure the model understands the required JSON structure and labeling conventions.",
  "improvement_strategy": "To address these issues, the following strategies can be implemented:\n\n  1. **Clarify Natural Variations:**\n     - Explicitly define typical ranges for natural variations (e.g., fruit coloration, size, and arrangement) and instruct the model to accept these as normal unless they exceed the defined thresholds.\n     - Provide more detailed examples of acceptable variations to help the model differentiate between normal and anomalous states.\n\n  2. **Enhance Anomaly Detection Criteria:**\n     - Specify that anomalies should be identified based on significant deviations from the reference sample, such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, contamination, or major structural changes.\n     - Encourage the model to focus on logical consistency and adherence to expected content, flagging any deviations that disrupt the expected composition.\n\n  3. **Improve Output Format Clarity:**\n     - Clearly state the required JSON format for the output, including the structure of bounding boxes and labels.\n     - Provide a more comprehensive example of the expected output to ensure the model understands the format requirements.\n\n  4. **Strengthen Contextual Understanding:**\n     - Include instructions to consider the context of the reference sample when evaluating the test image.\n     - Guide the model to prioritize detecting anomalies that deviate from the expected composition or logical consistency.\n\n  5. **Reduce Over-Sensitivity:**\n     - Instruct the model to ignore minor differences that do not impact the overall quality or safety of the product.\n     - Encourage the model to focus on significant deviations that are likely to indicate defects.\n\n  6. **Address Type Misclassifications:**\n     - Clarify the distinction between acceptable natural variations and unacceptable anomalies, ensuring the model correctly identifies and labels each type.\n     - Provide specific examples of anomalies that should be flagged, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions or contamination.\n\n  7. **Add Specific Instructions for Logical Consistency:**\n     - Emphasize the importance of checking for logical consistency, such as the presence of expected ingredients and their correct proportions.\n     - Encourage the model to flag any deviations from the expected composition as anomalies.\n\n  8. **Refine the Definition of \"Significant Deviations\":**\n     - Provide clearer guidance on what constitutes a \"significant deviation,\" such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, or major structural changes.\n     - Encourage the model to focus on deviations that are likely to impact the quality or safety of the product.\n\n  9. **Include Examples of Common Anomalies:**\n     - Provide examples of common anomalies, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions, discoloration, or contamination, to help the model better understand what to look for.\n     - Encourage the model to use these examples as a reference when evaluating the test image.\n\n  10. **Simplify the Prompt:**\n     - Ensure the prompt is concise and easy to understand, avoiding unnecessary complexity that could confuse the model.\n     - Focus on the most critical aspects of the task, such as identifying significant deviations and maintaining logical consistency.",
