Carefully compare the two images to determine if there are any anomalies in the test image.\n\n### Instructions:\n1. **Focus on Significant Deviations:** Identify anomalies based on significant deviations from the reference sample, such as unexpected substitutions, discoloration, contamination, or major structural changes. Acceptable natural variations (e.g., slight differences in fruit coloration, size, or arrangement) should be considered normal unless they exceed typical ranges.\n2. **Clarify Normal Variations:** Define typical ranges for natural variations (e.g., fruit coloration, size, and arrangement) and instruct the model to accept these as normal unless they exceed the defined thresholds. Provide examples of acceptable variations to help the model differentiate between normal and anomalous states.\n3. **Ensure Logical Consistency:** Pay attention to the overall composition and logical consistency of the contents. For example, if the reference sample includes nuts, the absence or substitution of nuts with another ingredient (e.g., dried banana slices) should be flagged as an anomaly.\n4. **Ignore Minor Differences:** Minor differences that do not impact the overall quality or safety of the product (e.g., slight scattering of granola or minor changes in fruit positioning) should be ignored.\n5. **Provide Examples of Common Anomalies:** Include examples of common anomalies, such as unexpected ingredient substitutions, discoloration, or contamination, to help the model better understand what to look for.\n6. **Output Format:** If no anomalies are found, respond with: `<answer>No</answer>`. If anomalies are found, respond with: `<answer>Yes</answer>` followed by a list of bounding boxes in JSON format:\n   ```json\n   [{\"bbox_2d\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"label\": \"anomaly_type\"}, ...]\n   ```\n\n### Example:\n```xml\n<answer>Yes</answer>\n[{\"bbox_2d\": [100, 150, 200, 250], \"label\": \"fruit_substitution\"}]\n```",
