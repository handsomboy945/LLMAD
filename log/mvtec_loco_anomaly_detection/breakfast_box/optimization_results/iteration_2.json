  "optimizer_analysis": "The current model exhibits severe performance degradation (Accuracy: 41.82%, Recall: 9.83%) due to two primary failure modes:\n\n1. **False Positives on Normal Variations**: The model consistently flags natural color variations in peaches (e.g., greenish-yellow patches) as anomalies, despite the prompt explicitly stating that such variations are NOT anomalies unless they indicate spoilage or damage. This suggests the model is over-relying on low-level visual differences rather than semantic plausibility.\n\n2. **False Negatives on Biologically Impossible Anomalies**: The model completely misses purple banana slices ‚Äî a clear biologically impossible feature ‚Äî indicating it fails to prioritize the ‚Äúbiologically implausible‚Äù criterion. In Case 5, it even rationalizes the presence of purple bananas as ‚Äúa different type of snack,‚Äù revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of anomaly definition.\n\n3. **Format Violations**: The model occasionally ignores the required JSON output format, suggesting insufficient enforcement of structural constraints.\n\nRoot causes:\n- Ambiguity in defining ‚Äúspoilage vs. normal variation‚Äù for fruits like peaches.\n- Insufficient emphasis on ‚Äúbiologically impossible‚Äù as a hard rule, not subject to interpretation.\n- Lack of explicit instruction to treat color deviations in non-living items (like dried fruit) as high-priority anomalies if implausible.\n- No penalty or reinforcement mechanism for ignoring core anomaly definitions.",
  "improvement_strategy": "1. **Reinforce Biological Impossibility as Non-Negotiable**: Explicitly state that any food item with a color, shape, or texture that violates known biological norms (e.g., purple bananas, blue apples) must be flagged as ‚ÄúYes‚Äù regardless of context.\n\n2. **Clarify Peach Color Variation Rules**: Add a specific rule: ‚ÄúGreenish-yellow patches on peaches are NORMAL unless accompanied by soft spots, mold, or oozing. Do NOT flag based on color alone.‚Äù\n\n3. **Introduce Anomaly Hierarchy**: Prioritize detection by anomaly type: \n   - Level 1: Biologically impossible ‚Üí Always ‚ÄúYes‚Äù\n   - Level 2: Physically impossible/structural defect ‚Üí ‚ÄúYes‚Äù\n   - Level 3: Contamination/damage ‚Üí ‚ÄúYes‚Äù if visible\n   - Level 4: Normal variation ‚Üí ‚ÄúNo‚Äù\n\n4. **Add Negative Reinforcement Examples**: Include explicit ‚ÄúDO NOT‚Äù examples for common false positives (e.g., ‚ÄúDO NOT flag peach color variation without spoilage signs‚Äù) and ‚ÄúMUST FLAG‚Äù examples for false negatives (e.g., ‚ÄúMUST flag purple bananas as ‚ÄòYes‚Äô‚Äù).\n\n5. **Enforce Format with Penalty Language**: Use phrases like ‚ÄúFailure to output valid JSON will result in automatic rejection‚Äù and ‚ÄúAll bounding boxes MUST be in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format.‚Äù\n\n6. **Add Confidence Calibration for Edge Cases**: Introduce ‚ÄúPossible‚Äù only for ambiguous cases where damage is suspected but not confirmed (e.g., slight bruising), and ‚ÄúUncertain‚Äù only when no visual evidence exists.\n\n7. **Include Real Anomaly Examples in Prompt**: Embed the purple banana case as a positive example to anchor the model‚Äôs understanding.",
